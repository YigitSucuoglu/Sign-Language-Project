# Sign-Language-Converter

# Overview
The Sign Language Converter is a computer vision-based application designed to convert American Sign Language (ASL) gestures into text. By using cameras, the application captures hand movements and translates them into corresponding letters of the alphabet in real-time. This project aims to bridge the communication gap between individuals who are proficient in ASL and those who may not understand sign language.

# Features
Real-time hand gesture recognition
Conversion of hand gestures to text
User-friendly interface
Support for basic American Sign Language alphabet

# How it Works
Launch the Program: Open the application on your computer.
Camera Setup: Ensure that your computer's camera is functional and positioned to capture hand gestures clearly.
Hand Gestures: Use your hands to make ASL gestures in front of the camera.
Conversion: The application will interpret the hand gestures and display the corresponding letters of the alphabet in real-time.
Word Formation: As you form letters with your hands, the application will combine them to form words.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
